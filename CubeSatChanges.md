# CubeSat Change Documentation
This file will be used for documenting any changes made as part of the CubeSat project.
At a minimum, it should list the files added/modified from the base Renode project. There should be additional documentation of the reasoning for any such changes if they are not well documented in the source of the file in question.

- [`CubeSatChanges.md`](CubeSatChanges.md)
    - *This file. Added for above reasons*
- [`CubeSatSetup.md`](CubeSatSetup.md)
    - *Added to document setup instructions*


## Modified:

- [`.gitmodules`](.gitmodules)
    - *Changed Infrastructure submodule to point at cubesatlab implementation*
